# TweetMoment
Edit tweet in the moment that you are not able to see in it.  
Just click the caret-down menu in the tweet url(not timeline tweet yet).  
You can see all of the moments that can add or delete the tweet from the moment.  
  
 Â 
NOTICE: It works ONLY tweet URL first loaded.  
That means, It works only the following URL first loaded: "https://twitter.com/(@ ID)/status/(tweet ID)"  
I'll update it soon, then it will work in other situation.
